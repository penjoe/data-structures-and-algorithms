# Stacks and Queues

Implementation and use of both a Stack and a Queue.

[Challenge 10 PR](https://github.com/penjoe/data-structures-and-algorithms/pull/)

## Challenge

Create both a Stack and a Queue in linked list form. There should be separate classes for nodes, Stacks and Queues. 

The Stack class should generate an empty Stack on instantiation. Within the class have all related methods for properly using a Stack, `push`, `pop` and `peek`. The new Stack should also point to the `top` of the Stack at all times. There should also be a method to return a boolean value depending on whether or not the Stack is empty.

For the Queue class, it should also create an empty Queue upon instantiation. The class should contain methods for using the Queue, `enqueue`, `dequeue` and `peek`. As with the Stack, there should also be a method to check if the Queue is empty or not, returning a boolean value.

Since this implementatio will be making a Stack and a Queue out of a linked list, the previously created linked list class will be used for that purpose.

## Approach & Efficiency

Time Complexity: O(n).
Space Complexity: O().
